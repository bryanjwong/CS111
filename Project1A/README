  1) lab1a.c
  ==========
  C program that configures the terminal to use non-canonical input that echoes
  the user keyboard input to stdout. ^D or ^C will exit the program, and upon
  exit all of the existing terminal settings are reset.

  Usage: ./lab1a [--shell=program]

  --shell option
  ==============
  If the --shell program argument is specified, that program is executed and
  connected to keyboard input using pipes. This allows for keyboard input to be
  passed into a shell program, such as /bin/bash, resulting in the shell output
  being displayed in stdout.

  Upon receiving the ^C input, a SIGINT kill signal will be sent to the shell.
  Upon receiving the ^D (EOF) input, the pipe to the shell will be closed but
    input from the shell will continue to be processed. Once that input reaches
    EOF, the program will exit.

  Upon program exit, the shell's status will be collected using wait() and
    displayed in the following format:

      SHELL EXIT SIGNAL=# STATUS=#

  Here is a summary of exit codes:

    0   normal execution, shutdown on ^D
    1   unrecognized argument or system call failure

  2) Makefile
  ===========
  The Makefile includes the following targets:

    lab1a (default)       compiles lab1a.c into an executable

    clean                 removes files generated by this Makefile

    dist                  generates the submission tar file
