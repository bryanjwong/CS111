  1+2) lab4c_tcp.c and lab4c_tls.c:
  =================================
  C programs that use the BeagleBone Green's GPIO and Analog input pins to read values from a Temperature Sensor. When a button
  is pressed, a GPIO interrupt is triggered that terminates the program with an output message.

  Temperature output values are of the following format:
        HH:MM:SS TEMP

  The following options can be used to configure the program:
        --period=seconds            Configures the sampling period, in seconds.
        --scale=F/C                 Configures whether temperature should be output in Fahrenheit/Celsius. Defaults to Fahrenheit.
        --log=filename              Specifies a file for all output to be logged to.

  Both programs make a TCP or TLS server connection, accordingly. They take the following required arguments:

        --host=hostname             Server host name or address
        --id=idnum                  9 digit id number used to identify self to server
        Port Number (non-option)    Server port to connect to

  The program will read command inputs from the server and send temperature recordings to it.
  
  If invalid command line arguments are encountered, the program will exit with error code 1.
  
  If run-time failures such as the server being rejected or the session being closed are encountered, the prorgam will exit with 
  error code 2.

  3) Makefile:
  ============

  The Makefile includes the following targets:

    default               compiles lab4c_tls and lab4c_tcp

    clean                 removes files generated by this Makefile

    dist                  generates the submission tar file
