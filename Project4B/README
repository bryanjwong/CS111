Included Files:
===============

  1) lab4b.c:
  ===========
  C program that uses the BeagleBone Green's GPIO and Analog input pins to read values from a Temperature Sensor. When a button
  is pressed, a GPIO interrupt is triggered that terminates the program with an output message.

  Temperature output values are of the following format:
        HH:MM:SS TEMP

  The following options can be used to configure the program:
        --period=seconds            Configures the sampling period, in seconds.
        --scale=F/C                 Configures whether temperature should be output in Fahrenheit/Celsius. Defaults to Fahrenheit.
        --log=filename              Specifies a file for all output to be logged to.

  Upon a failed system call, the program will exit with error code 1.

  2) tests.sh
  ===========
  A bash script that tests each of the user input commands ("SCALE=F", "SCALE=C", "PERIOD=1", "STOP", "START", "LOG HELLO", "OFF").
  A message is printed to STDOUT indicating whether the test passed or failed.

  3) Makefile:
  ============

  The Makefile includes the following targets:

    default               compiles lab4b.c

    clean                 removes files generated by this Makefile

    check                 runs the tests.sh test script

    dist                  generates the submission tar file
